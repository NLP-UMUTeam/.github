# NLP-UMUTeam @ Universidad de Murcia

We are the **NLP-UMUTeam**, a research group at the University of Murcia (Spain) focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for Spanish and multilingual settings.

We frequently participate in shared tasks and evaluation campaigns (SemEval, IberLEF, CLEF, etc.), and we publish in international journals and conferences on NLP and language technologies.

Our *main research lines* include:
- Text classification & author profiling
- Hate & hope speech detection (Spanish and multilingual)
- Sentiment & emotion analysis (text and multimodal speech–text)
- Misinformation, satire and political communication
- Clinical NLP and domain-specific resources for Spanish
